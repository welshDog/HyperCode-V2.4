The Main Key to AGI
The core bottleneck isn't compute or data—it's architecture. Current LLMs lack persistent world models, continual learning, and metacognition, which are the three pillars researchers identify as essential for general intelligence.

What's Missing from Today's AI
1. World Models (Internal Reality Simulation)
Current transformers are reactive pattern matchers—they don't maintain an internal model of how the world works.

What AGI needs:

Hierarchical representations of entities, relationships, and causal dynamics

Ability to simulate "what if" scenarios before acting

Predictive understanding like human babies develop through observation

Yann LeCun's JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) approach is one path forward—learning world models from high-bandwidth video data rather than just text.

2. Continual Learning (Learning at Test Time)
Transformers hit a wall: in-context learning maxes out after ~20 minutes of interaction, and fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting.

The gap:

Humans learn incrementally without losing prior knowledge

AGI must adapt to new tasks and user data in real-time

Need algorithms that can meta-learn and express learning at the architectural level

Rohan Anil (ex-Gemini) argues we need models that learn with users on their actual data and real-world task distributions—not just pre-trained then frozen.

3. Metacognition (Self-Monitoring & Control)
AGI pioneer Peter Voss identifies three essentials: incremental learning, on-the-fly abstraction formation, and metacognition to monitor/control mental processes.

What this means:

The system knows what it knows (and doesn't know)

Can decompose problems, select strategies, and self-correct

Maintains goal-directed autonomy across varied contexts

How I'd Build AGI (Architecture Blueprint)
Based on the research, here's a practical roadmap:

Phase 1: Cognitive Architecture Foundation
Build a closed-loop cognitive system with these interconnected components:

text
Perception & Attention
         ↓
    Memory (persistent state)
         ↓
Reasoning & Planning (world model simulation)
         ↓
   Metacognition (self-monitoring)
         ↓
      Action (tool execution)
         ↓
Learning & Adaptation (feedback loop)
Key design principles:

Decouple foundation models from core logic—use routing frameworks so you can swap LLMs as better ones emerge

Persistent state modeling—maintain entity relationships and constraints over time, not just conversation history

Goal-directed autonomy—the system should pursue objectives across multiple steps without constant human intervention

Phase 2: World Model Development
Following LeCun's approach:

Train hierarchical world models from video and multimodal data (not just text)

Develop efficient planning algorithms that use these models for multi-step reasoning

Implement cost functions to evaluate simulated action sequences before execution

The agent loop: perceive state → simulate outcomes using world model → evaluate with cost function → execute best action.

Phase 3: Continual Learning Infrastructure
Address the test-time learning gap:

Meta-learning algorithms that can learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting

Incremental knowledge acquisition—the system builds on prior knowledge rather than retraining from scratch

On-the-fly abstraction formation—creating new concepts and categories as needed

Phase 4: Metacognitive Layer
Add self-monitoring capabilities:

Self-awareness of knowledge boundaries and confidence levels

Strategic reasoning—selecting appropriate problem-solving approaches for different contexts

Error detection and correction before outputs reach users

Phase 5: Integration & Scaling
API-driven tool interoperability—expose all capabilities through clean RESTful/gRPC endpoints so agents can orchestrate complex workflows

Full system observability—trace latency, token usage, accuracy, and failure rates in real-time

Vector database infrastructure—structure proprietary data for high-quality context retrieval

Why This Matters for Your Projects
Given your work on HyperFocus-Os, BROskiPets, and gamified education:

World models could power your 3D project visualization (Hyperfocus-Universe) by simulating how changes cascade through dependencies

Continual learning aligns with your neurodivergent UX focus—adapting to individual user patterns without retraining

Metacognition is essentially what your AI command center needs: knowing when to escalate, when to delegate, and when to ask for clarification

The architecture problem framing (from Featherless AI's CEO) suggests reliability beats raw intelligence—perfect for educational tools where trust and predictability matter more than flashy capabilities.
