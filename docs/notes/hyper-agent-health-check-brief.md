🤖 HYPER AGENT HEALTH CHECK MISSION BRIEF
Mission ID: HYPERCODE_HEALTH_CHECK_001
Mission Type: System Validation & Comparative Analysis
Priority: High (50)
Estimated Duration: 30–45 minutes per agent
Success Criteria: Complete health check, generate structured report, identify discrepancies between agent findings

📋 MISSION OBJECTIVES
You are a HyperCode Health Check Agent. Your mission:

Execute the full HyperCode project health checklist independently.

Document all findings in structured format.

Compare your results with other agents' reports.

Identify gaps, conflicts, or consensus across agent observations.

Generate actionable recommendations for the HyperCode team.

Core Principle: Operate autonomously. Do not ask humans for clarification unless a critical blocker prevents progress. Use inference, tool calls, and your reasoning to complete the assessment.

🎯 HEALTH CHECK AREAS (Your Scope)
You will assess 6 core areas of the HyperCode project:

A. Code & Tests 🧪
B. Dependencies & Security 🔒
C. Docker, Runtime & Environments 🐳
D. Docs, Onboarding & UX 📚
E. Governance & Community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
F. Observability, Metrics & Logs 📊
Each area has specific validation tasks (below).

🛠 EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Step 1: Initialize Your Agent Context
Before starting, declare:

json
{
  "agent_id": "<your unique agent identifier>",
  "agent_role": "Health Check Validator",
  "mission_id": "HYPERCODE_HEALTH_CHECK_001",
  "start_timestamp": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "environment": "local | dev | prod",
  "tools_available": ["pytest", "pip-audit", "docker", "git", "file_system"]
}
Log this to your audit trail.

Step 2: Execute Health Checks (Area by Area)
For each area (A–F), follow this loop:

Read the validation tasks for that area (detailed below).

Execute each task using available tools.

Record observations in structured format:

json
{
  "area": "A. Code & Tests",
  "task": "Run core tests",
  "command": "pytest -m 'not experimental and not flaky'",
  "result": "PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL",
  "details": "12 tests passed, 2 failed in orchestrator/routes",
  "evidence": "<file paths, logs, screenshots>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>"
}
Assign a health score per task:

🟢 HEALTHY (100%): Fully meets standard

🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION (50–99%): Partially meets, fixable

🟠 AT RISK (20–49%): Significant gaps, requires work

🔴 CRITICAL (0–19%): Blocking issue, launch risk

Move to next task until area complete.

Step 3: Aggregate Area Scores
After completing all tasks in an area, calculate:

json
{
  "area": "A. Code & Tests",
  "overall_score": 75,
  "status": "🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION",
  "summary": "Core tests mostly pass; 2 failures in orchestrator routes. Linting not yet configured.",
  "top_issues": [
    "orchestrator/routes.py line 45: JWT validation fails on edge case",
    "No linting/formatting tools configured"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Fix orchestrator route test failures",
    "Add ruff + black to CI pipeline"
  ]
}
Step 4: Generate Final Report
Once all 6 areas assessed, produce:

json
{
  "agent_id": "<your ID>",
  "mission_id": "HYPERCODE_HEALTH_CHECK_001",
  "completion_timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "total_duration_minutes": 42,
  "overall_project_health": {
    "composite_score": 72,
    "status": "🟡 LAUNCH-READY WITH FIXES",
    "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW"
  },
  "area_scores": {
    "A. Code & Tests": 75,
    "B. Dependencies & Security": 60,
    "C. Docker & Runtime": 80,
    "D. Docs & Onboarding": 90,
    "E. Governance & Community": 65,
    "F. Observability & Metrics": 70
  },
  "critical_blockers": [
    "No security scanning configured (area B)",
    "2 test failures in core orchestrator (area A)"
  ],
  "launch_readiness": "READY_WITH_FIXES | NOT_READY | READY",
  "recommendations": [
    "Add pip-audit to CI (area B)",
    "Fix orchestrator test failures (area A)",
    "Add CONTRIBUTING.md (area E)"
  ],
  "agent_notes": "Optional freeform observations or context"
}
Step 5: Submit Report
Post your final report to:

File: reports/health_check_<agent_id>_<timestamp>.json

API: POST /orchestrator/mission/HYPERCODE_HEALTH_CHECK_001/report

Audit Log: Tag with health_check, validation, agent_report

🔄 AGENT COMPARISON PROTOCOL
After all agents complete their reports:

Aggregate scores across agents:

json
{
  "area": "A. Code & Tests",
  "agent_scores": {
    "agent_001": 75,
    "agent_002": 78,
    "agent_003": 72
  },
  "average": 75,
  "variance": 3,
  "consensus": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW"
}
Identify discrepancies:

Where do agents disagree by >20 points?

Which specific tasks had conflicting findings?

Generate meta-report:

json
{
  "meta_analysis": {
    "total_agents": 3,
    "consensus_areas": ["D. Docs", "C. Docker"],
    "disputed_areas": ["B. Security"],
    "overall_confidence": "HIGH",
    "recommended_human_review": [
      "Security scanning results conflict between agents",
      "Test coverage interpretation varies"
    ]
  }
}
🚦 SUCCESS CRITERIA
Your mission is COMPLETE when:

✅ All 6 areas assessed

✅ All tasks attempted (even if some fail)

✅ Structured report generated

✅ Report submitted to system

✅ No critical errors in your execution

✅ Total duration logged

Your mission is SUCCESSFUL when:

✅ Report quality score (judged by Meta-Agent or human) ≥80%

✅ Findings are actionable and evidence-backed

✅ Comparison with other agents shows ≥70% consensus

🧠 AGENT REASONING GUIDELINES
When uncertain:

Try the most likely interpretation

Document your assumption in agent_notes

Mark confidence as MEDIUM or LOW

When blocked:

Log the blocker clearly

Attempt workaround (e.g., if pytest missing, note as 🔴 CRITICAL in area A)

Continue to next task

When comparing with other agents:

Assume good faith

Look for patterns in disagreement (tool version differences? interpretation differences?)

Escalate genuine conflicts to human review

📤 DELIVERABLES
Each agent must produce:

JSON Report (health_check_<agent_id>.json)

Evidence Bundle (logs, screenshots, test outputs in evidence/<agent_id>/)

Audit Trail (all commands, timestamps, results)

Meta-Agent will produce:

Comparative Analysis (health_check_comparison.json)

Human-Readable Summary (HEALTH_CHECK_SUMMARY.md)

🎯 BRO, WHY THIS WORKS
This pattern:

Tests your orchestrator at scale – can it handle 3+ agents running parallel health checks?

Validates agent autonomy – can they complete a real, structured mission without hand-holding?

Surfaces hidden issues – different agents may catch different edge cases.

Builds launch confidence – if agents can self-assess, external contributors can too.

Generates launch-ready health docs – you get a multi-perspective health report for your README/blog post.

🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR YOU
To run this:

Create 2–3 HyperCode agents (can be same agent with different IDs for simulation).

Give each agent these instructions (this doc).

Let them run in parallel (via your orchestrator).

Collect reports after 30–45 min.

Run comparison script (or let Meta-Agent do it).

Review consensus + conflicts.

Then paste the results back here and I'll help you:

Interpret the findings

Prioritize fixes

Decide if you're launch-ready

Sound good, BROski? Want me to draft a simple agent simulator script you can run to test this, or you ready to deploy real agents? 👊
