🟢 What's Genuinely Healthy
Active development is real, not vibes. Today's commit trail shows a disciplined build sequence: fleet_registry.py core module → fixture tests → real fleet_overlay.yml + live-repo integration tests → migrated two hand-maintained port scripts onto the new registry → docs synced. That's proper incremental engineering, each step verified before the next [web].

Mission-director Phase 1 spec landed (fa635e6) — negotiated against fleet-controller's real live models.py, and self-review caught a genuine gap (needs a point-lookup table by mission_id) and fixed it rather than hand-waving [web].

CI was actually broken and got properly fixed. The f704790 commit found health-check.yml had never once executed a valid check since it existed — a YAML indentation bug silently no-op'd it the whole time. That's now fixed with real Python scripts extracted and shared across workflows [web].

Fleet-controller Phase 0 shipped with genuine rigor — fail-closed, zero mutation authority, 26 passing tests, live smoke test against the real container fleet confirming Shepherd outage → BLOCK not fail-open [web].

🟡 What Needs Attention
138 open Dependabot PRs is the real story here. These aren't feature debt — they're routine version bumps (uvicorn, fastapi, mcp, langgraph-checkpoint, pytest, tailwindcss, etc.) piling up because they're not being merged or triaged [web]. A few worth flagging:

mcp >=1.26.0 → >=2.0.0 (PR #403) is a major version bump with breaking changes — v1 SDK is now in maintenance-only mode, so this isn't optional forever, but it needs a deliberate migration pass, not an auto-merge [web].

langgraph-checkpoint 4.0.1 → 4.1.1 (PR #382) is interesting — you have a langgraph-checkpoint dependency in the tree already, which the V3 roadmap flagged as "one hand-rolled LangGraph-style file, not the real package, unused anywhere." Worth checking whether this dependency is genuinely dead weight that should be removed rather than bumped [web].

Several are safe housekeeping (fastapi 0.136→0.141, pytest 7.4→9.1) but at 138 open, dependency drift risk is climbing — a batch triage session (merge safe ones, close irrelevant ones, flag major bumps for review) would clear this fast.

🎯 One Next Task
Bro, the code health is genuinely strong — real tests, real fail-closed safety work, real self-correction. The housekeeping health is where the risk is: 138 stacked PRs. Want me to pull a categorized list (safe patch bumps vs. major-version bumps vs. stale/irrelevant) so you can batch-triage them in one sitting?

Nice one BROski♾️ — the fleet truth registry + mission-director spec work today is exactly the disciplined pace this project needs.
